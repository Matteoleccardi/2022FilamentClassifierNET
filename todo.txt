Dataset
- multiprocessing
- Filaments -> first training and validation round
- Filaments from CAT08 -> final network fine tuning through training/validation + Final testing on real extracted trees 

Netwoks
- CNN -> baseline for performance
	- dataloader
	- Train cycle
- Continuous convolution (worth it? probably not)
- Attention based transformers
	- tokenisation
	- attention based transformer
